Times AFTER 1962 are in UTC, the current\ncivil or 'wall-clock' time-scale. UTC is kept within 0.9 seconds of UT1\nusing integer leap-seconds for 1972 and later years.\n \n  Conversion from the internal Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) of solar\nsystem dynamics to the non-uniform civil UT time-scale requested for output\nhas not been determined for UTC times after the next July or January 1st.\nTherefore, the last known leap-second is used as a constant over future\nintervals.\n \n  Time tags refer to the UT time-scale conversion from TDB on Earth\nregardless of observer location within the solar system, although clock\nrates may differ due to the local gravity field and no analog to 'UT'\nmay be defined for that location.\n \n  Any 'b' symbol in the 1st-column denotes a B.C. date. First-column blank\n(' ') denotes an A.D. date.\n  \nCALENDAR SYSTEM\n  Mixed calendar mode was active such that calendar dates after AD 1582-Oct-15\n(if any) are in the modern Gregorian system. Dates prior to 1582-Oct-5 (if any)\nare in the Julian calendar system, which is automatically extended for dates\nprior to its adoption on 45-Jan-1 BC.  The Julian calendar is useful for\nmatching historical dates. The Gregorian calendar more accurately corresponds\nto the Earth's orbital motion and seasons. A 'b' or 'B' denotes a B.C. date.\n \n  STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTIES\n \n  Output includes formal +/- 3 standard-deviation statistical orbit uncertainty\nquantities. There is a 99.7% chance the actual value is within given bounds.\nThese statistical calculations assume observational data errors are random. If\nthere are systematic biases (such as timing, reduction or star-catalog errors),\nactual uncertainties could exceed statistical values. In the presence of such\nbiases, results may be more accurately characterized using averaged offset\nexpectations, residual plots, and comparable sample results. Dynamical (process)\nmodeling errors may also exist and are not included in these formal statistics.\n \nSYMBOLS\n  \n  Meaning of computed values for each column are as follows:\n \n  JDTDB\n      Epoch Julian Date, Barycentric Dynamical Time\n  Calendar Date (TDB)\n      Calendar date (Gregorian) and time (TDB) corresponding to the epoch.\n  EC\n      Eccentricity, e                                                   \n  QR\n      Periapsis distance, q (au)                                        \n  IN\n      Inclination w.r.t X-Y plane, i (degrees)                          \n  OM\n      Longitude of Ascending Node, OMEGA, (degrees)                     \n  W\n      Argument of Perifocus, w (degrees)                                \n  Tp\n      Time of periapsis (Julian Day Number)                             \n  N\n      Mean motion, n (degrees/sec)                                      \n  MA\n      Mean anomaly, M (degrees)                                         \n  TA\n      True anomaly, nu (degrees)                                        \n  A\n      Semi-major axis, a (au)                                           \n  AD\n      Apoapsis distance (au)                                            \n  PR\n      Sidereal orbit period (sec)                                       \n \nComputations by ...\n    Solar System Dynamics Group, Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System\n    4800 Oak Grove Drive, Jet Propulsion Laboratory\n    Pasadena, CA  91109   USA\n    Information: http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/\n    Connect    : telnet://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov:6775  (via browser)\n                 http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons\n                 telnet ssd.jpl.nasa.gov 6775    (via command-line)\n    Author     : Jon.D.Giorgini@jpl.nasa.gov\n*******************************************************************************\n"
