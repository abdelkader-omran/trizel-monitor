## Provenance Map

Each DOI in this registry represents a distinct evidence artifact. The AUTO DZ ACT system SHALL:

1. Only ingest DOIs explicitly listed in this document
2. Never infer or auto-discover additional DOIs
3. Record provenance metadata for each ingested artifact
4. Maintain immutable RAW records for audit and verification

## Modification Policy

Adding a new DOI to this registry requires:
- Explicit verification of DOI validity
- Documentation of its role in the AUTO DZ ACT evidence chain
- Addition to the appropriate category above

This file is the single source of truth for recognized DOIs.
