# TRIZEL Monitor

**TRIZEL Monitor** is an automated scientific monitoring system designed to track, collect, and archive all *officially published data* related to the interstellar object **3I/ATLAS**.

The project is built to operate with **zero daily manual intervention**, relying on GitHub Actions to execute scheduled and on-demand monitoring workflows.

---

## Objectives

- Continuous monitoring of official datasets released by:
  - NASA / JPL
  - ESA
  - CNSA
  - JAXA
  - MPC and other recognized international institutions
- Centralized archival of observation timestamps and update signals
- Strict attribution to original official sources
- Reproducible and auditable automation logic (AUTO DZ ACT framework)

---

## Automation

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow:

- **Daily Official Data Monitor**
  - Manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`)
  - Scheduled execution (UTC-based)
  - Python-based monitoring logic
  - Automatic logging of execution timestamps

All automation is executed inside GitHub infrastructure.  
No local machine or external server is required.

---

## Scientific Integrity

This repository does **not** modify, reinterpret, or alter official datasets.  
Its role is limited to **monitoring, indexing, and traceability**.

All analyses derived from this system must explicitly reference original sources.

## Raw Data Policy

**Raw Data Definition:**  
Raw data in this repository refers to unmodified data obtained directly from official international space agencies through their public APIs or data repositories.

**Requirements:**
- All RAW_DATA must originate from whitelisted international space agencies
- Each RAW_DATA file must include verifiable provenance metadata
- Direct download links or API endpoints must be documented
- Independent verification of data sources is required

**Whitelisted Space Agencies:**
- **NASA** (United States) — https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/
- **ESA** (European Space Agency)
- **CNSA** (China National Space Administration)
- **Roscosmos** (Russian Space Agency)
- **JAXA** (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency)
- **MPC** (Minor Planet Center - IAU)

**Current Raw Data Sources:**
- NASA/JPL Small-Body Database (SBDB) API
- Endpoint: https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.api
- License: NASA Open Data Policy (Public Domain)

**Verification:**  
All raw data files are tagged with `data_class: "RAW_DATA"` and include cryptographic checksums for integrity verification.

---

## Snapshot Limitation

**Important Scientific Distinction:**

**Snapshots are NOT raw data.** They are timestamped captures of system state or aggregated information.

**Snapshot Characteristics:**
- `data_class: "SNAPSHOT"`
- Generated by internal pipeline processes
- May aggregate multiple raw data sources
- Include metadata linking to source raw data
- Useful for archival and temporal analysis
- **Cannot** be used as primary scientific evidence without tracing to raw data sources

**Snapshot-to-Raw-Data Linkage:**  
Every snapshot must reference at least one RAW_DATA source. Snapshots without raw linkage are flagged as non-scientific archival artifacts.

**Example:**
- `official_snapshot_3I_ATLAS_20251221_034514.json` → SNAPSHOT
- References: `jpl_sbdb_*.json` files → RAW_DATA (NASA/JPL)

## International Agency Sources

This repository connects to and archives data from official international space agencies to ensure scientific credibility and traceability.

**Active Data Sources:**

### NASA (United States)
- **Small-Body Database (SBDB)** — Orbital and physical parameters
  - API: https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.api
  - Status: Active, automated retrieval
  - Data Class: RAW_DATA
  - License: Public Domain (CC0-1.0)

**Registry of Additional Official Platforms:**

The repository maintains a versioned registry of official platforms relevant to 3I/ATLAS monitoring:

- **Minor Planet Center (MPC)** — IAU clearinghouse for astrometry/orbits
- **NASA/JPL Horizons** — Ephemerides and observer geometry
- **ESA Archives** — Mission data and space telescope observations
- **ESO Science Archive** — Ground-based observatory data
- **JAXA** — Missions and collaboration context

**Note:** Not all platforms provide machine-fetchable APIs. The registry serves as a citation and expansion target for future automation.

**Data Connectivity Verification:**  
All automated data retrieval is logged with timestamps, endpoints, and verification status. Manual inspection of agency sources is performed periodically to ensure continued availability.

---

## Data Classification System

All data files in this repository are classified using mandatory metadata:

- **RAW_DATA** — Original data from official space agencies
- **SNAPSHOT** — Timestamped system state captures
- **DERIVED** — Processed or synthesized data

See `METADATA_SCHEMA.md` for complete specification.

**Validation:**  
Metadata compliance is enforced via CI/CD. Files lacking proper metadata will fail validation.

**Manifest:**  
`data/DATA_MANIFEST.json` provides a machine-readable catalog of all classified data artifacts.

---

## Status

- Automation: **Active**
- Last execution: recorded automatically
- Maintenance: not required for daily operation
- Metadata Compliance: **100%** (verified by CI)
- Raw Data Provenance: **Explicit and traceable**
